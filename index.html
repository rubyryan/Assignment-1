    <p>Adeola Adeleye is a Business Development Executive for Remedy Gate Limited. Previously worked as sales manager
        for Bayfad Estates Ltd for 2 years before joining Remedy Gate Limited in 2018. Born on July 6, 1989, in Nigeria.
        I came from a family of 7, and the last child of the family. I embarked on a journey that would shape my life in
        remarkable ways. My early years were spent growing up in the vibrant and diverse culture of Nigeria, a country
        that instilled in me a strong sense of community and resilience.

        My educational journey began with primary school, where I laid the foundation for my academic pursuits. I
        attended a local primary school, where I was introduced to the world of learning and started building
        friendships that would last a lifetime.

        I attendend FGC Ikole, as I progressed to secondary school, my thirst for knowledge deepened. I embraced the
        challenges of a more advanced curriculum and developed a passion for subjects that would later guide my career
        choices. Secondary school not only broadened my horizons but also taught me the importance of discipline and
        hard work.

        Upon completing my secondary education, I pursued higher learning at University of Cape Coast, Ghana where I
        earned a BSc in Buisness Information Systems. This was a pivotal chapter in my life, as I dove into my chosen
        field of study, further honing my skills and knowledge. My time at the university not only provided me with a
        quality education but also exposed me to diverse perspectives and experiences.

        After graduating, I served (NYSC) my dear country for a year before embarking on my professional journey. I
        gained valuable work experience in two different companies over a span of 5 years. These experiences allowed me
        to apply the knowledge I had acquired in a practical setting and develop a strong work ethic. I worked with
        dedication and continuously sought opportunities for growth and improvement. Looking to improve my skills and
        knowledge, in the year 2021 I embarked on another educational journey to earn myself an MSc in Managing
        Innovations and Information Technology at University of Salford, UK.

        Throughout my life, the values of community, hard work, and perseverance instilled in me during my formative
        years in Nigeria have remained a guiding force. These principles have shaped my personal and professional life,
        enabling me to overcome challenges and make meaningful contributions to the organizations I have been a part of.

        As I continue on my journey, I look forward to new opportunities and challenges that will help me further evolve
        as a person and contribute to the community and society that have played a significant role in shaping the
        individual I am today.</p>
